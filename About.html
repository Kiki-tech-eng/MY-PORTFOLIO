      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Gloria Kusoro, a communicator with a passion for community building, public relations,
         and social media management. I enjoy creating meaningful interactions, whether through content, 
         engagement strategies, or virtual events. Over the years, I've worked on various projects in PR, event coordination, and branding, 
         helping businesses and communities grow by fostering engagement and building strong connections.</p>

         <p>Beyond work, I'm deeply passionate about raising awareness for children with special needs and creating safe spaces where families can find support, 
          understanding, and a sense of belonging. I've seen firsthand the challenges that both children and their families face the struggles, 
  the victories, and the moments that often go unnoticed. This experience has fueled my commitment to advocating for better awareness, inclusion, 
  and support systems for these children and their loved ones.</p>
<p>I believe that communication is a powerful tool for transformation. Whether it's helping a brand build a loyal audience, 
  creating engaging content that sparks conversations, or fostering communities that empower people, 
  my goal is to use my skills to drive meaningful change. As I continue this journey, I am dedicated to expanding my expertise, 
  building impactful communities, both online and offline, and creating spaces where people feel seen, heard, and valued.</p>
